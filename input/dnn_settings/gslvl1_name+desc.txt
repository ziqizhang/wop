#Experiment setting files to be used by 'exp_wop_dnn.py' or 'exp_wop_non_dnn.py'. Each of this setting file should differentiate in terms of input text field to be used for feature extraction (e.g., name, desc, see property 'training_text_data' and 'training_text_data_columns'); and additional pre-processed features to be combined with text features, if any, see 'training_other_features'); and embedding model files if DNN is used (See property 'embedding_file')
