#Fieldnames in the mwpd SWC2020 dataset:

#Each of this setting file should differentiate in terms of input text field to be used for feature extraction (e.g., name, desc, see property 'training_text_data' and 'training_text_data_columns'); and additional pre-processed features to be combined with text features, if any, see 'training_other_features'); and embedding model files if DNN is used (See property 'embedding_file')

#give a label to this setting and it is used to append to every algorithm that is run in the target python file to identify the results in the output CSV file
